- 👋 Hi, my name's @AdderrDev ( or Adderr, Whichever you prefer ).
- 👀 I’m a young coder and interested in using GitHub to look at open-source projects and learn.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning about C# as it's my primary coding language, but I learn still learn about all sorts of stuff.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate with anyone on anything as I'm an mostly independent coder, and my projects are for my friends.
- 📫 But, that being said, if you want to reach me, you can message @eAdderr on Twitter.

- At this time, there’s no need to, but if needed, I will update this file :]
